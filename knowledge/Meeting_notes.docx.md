# SmartAssist Mtg Notes \- May 1

TechNova LLM proj \- pre-kickoff call

People:

* Sarah (CEO) \- enthusiastic, clear on biz needs

* Alex (CTO) \- tech lead, knows what he wants

* Maya (Head of Eng) \- will be our main contact, seems competent\!

What they want:

* Internal LLM to search across their systems \- KNOWLEDGE SILOS forming

* Team wasting \~30% TIME (\!\!\!) just looking for info or answering same Qs repeatedly

* Small team (5-8 ppl) but growing

* Need better docs \+ easier onboarding

MAIN PAIN POINT \= devs can't find info across systems, repeating work

Integration priorities:

* GitHub \+ Notion \= TOP priority\!\!\! (code \+ docs)

* Maya specifically mentioned code documentation as big pain

* Slack \= important but secondary

* GDrive \= nice to have

* Try to get all 4 if possible by end \*

Tech stuff:

* RAG system w/ OpenAI (GPT-4? ask later)

* Need vector DB \- they mentioned Pinecone/Weaviate

* Must deploy on AWS (they already use it)

* Python backend \+ TypeScript/React frontend

* SECURITY CRITICAL \- data can't leave their systems\!\!

* check if we need data processing pipeline for code understanding

$$ Budget:

* $20-25K for implementation \- CONFIRMED

* \~$650/mo ongoing (API, maintenance)

* they seem cost-conscious \- startups lol

Timing:

* No hard deadline but want by mid-Aug

* Sept \= new hires coming in

* 3 months should work

Success \= 

* 50% less time searching (THIS IS KEY)

* 80% accurate answers

* Cut onboarding: 4wks → 2wks

* need to make sure users actually adopt it\!

Maya \= dedicated contact person (25% time) \- GOOD\!

To do:

* Draft project charter by Fri\!\!\! 

* Get system docs from Alex tmrw

* Need team ready 7-10 days after charter approved

* Set up milestones in charter (early win?)

Random thoughts:

* They seem to have solid foundation, good technical understanding

* GitHub integration \= biggest pain \- START HERE

* Maya gets it \- will be good partner

* Team seems aligned on needs (good sign)

* Fast ROI important \- they're burning $ on inefficiency

* Need to find dev who knows code understanding/documentation well

* Maybe build simple prototype first to show progress?

* Need to manage expectations on accuracy \- LLMs hallucinate\!

Next:

* Charter (Scope) draft → review → approval

* Find right devs (ML \+ coding exp)

* Get Alex's docs ASAP

* Book kickoff when ready
