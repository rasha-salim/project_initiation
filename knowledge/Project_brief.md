# Project Brief: SmartAssist \- Internal LLM Solution

## 1\. Project Overview

* **Project Name**: SmartAssist

* **Client**: Internal (TechNova Startup)

* **Project Sponsor**: Sarah Chen, CEO

* **Project Lead**: Alex Rivera, CTO

* **Date Created**: May 6, 2025

* **Version**: 1.0

## 2\. Project Background

TechNova is a growing startup focused on developing customized software solutions for small to medium businesses. As we scale from 15 to an anticipated 30+ employees this year, we've identified increasing inefficiencies in our internal knowledge management, customer support, and code documentation processes. Our team spends approximately 30% of their time searching for information across various documentation systems, answering repetitive client questions, and documenting code. We believe implementing an internal LLM solution can significantly reduce this overhead and improve productivity.

## 3\. Business Case

### Business Problem

* Knowledge silos are forming as the team grows

* Significant time lost searching for information across Notion, GitHub, Slack, and Google Drive

* Inconsistent documentation quality leading to longer onboarding times for new hires

* Engineering team spending 10+ hours weekly answering repetitive technical questions

* Limited ability to leverage past client solutions for new business opportunities

### Business Objectives

* Reduce time spent searching for information by 50%

* Decrease onboarding time for new employees from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.

* Enable self-service for 70% of common internal questions.

* Improve code documentation quality and consistency.

* Create a foundation for a potential future client-facing AI assistant.s

### Expected Business Value

* 15% increase in engineering capacity for billable work

* Improved employee satisfaction and reduced frustration

* Faster response times to client inquiries

* Better knowledge retention as the company scales

## 4\. Project Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goal

Create a customized LLM solution that centralizes our company knowledge, automates repetitive tasks, and provides intelligent assistance to team members.

### Specific Objectives

* Build a secure, private LLM application that can access our internal systems.

* Train the model on our company documentation, codebase, and past communications.

* Implement natural language interfaces across our primary work platforms.

* Develop specific capabilities for code documentation and technical Q\&A.

* Establish usage analytics to measure impact and ROI.

### Success Metrics

* 50% reduction in time spent searching for information.

* 80% accuracy in answering internal questions.

* 90% employee adoption within 2 months.

* 40% reduction in repeated questions to senior team members.

* Positive satisfaction scores (\>4.2/5) from user feedback.

## 5\. Target Audience/Users

* **Primary Users**: Technical team (developers, designers, project managers)

* **Secondary Users**: Non-technical staff (sales, operations, HR)
